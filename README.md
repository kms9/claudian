# Obsidian Claude Agent

An Obsidian plugin that embeds Claude Code as a sidebar chat interface. Your vault becomes Claude's working directory, giving it full agentic capabilities: file read/write, bash commands, and multi-step workflows.

## Features

- **Sidebar chat interface**: Talk to Claude without leaving Obsidian
- **Full Claude Code capabilities**: Read, write, edit files, run bash commands
- **Vault-aware**: Claude operates with your vault as the working directory
- **Streaming responses**: See Claude's responses in real-time
- **Tool call visualization**: Collapsible UI showing tool inputs and results (like Claude Code CLI)
- **Chat history persistence**: Conversations saved across sessions with easy switching
- **Session resume**: Continue previous conversations with full context
- **Safety blocklist**: Optionally block dangerous commands

## Requirements

- [Claude Code CLI](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code) installed (the SDK uses it internally)
- Obsidian v1.0.0+
- Desktop only (macOS, Linux, Windows via WSL)

   ```
